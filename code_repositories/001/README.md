# Conduit

This repository contains a full-stack TypeScript application consisting of a NestJS backend and an Angular frontend. You have two options for using this repository: Gitpod (recommended) or [local](./LOCAL.md) (will require up to 60 minutes of set-up time).

## Running in Gitpod

You can sign up for a free Gitpod account here: https://www.gitpod.io/ using your GitHub account. After you sign up, you can open the following link to launch your environment: https://www.gitpod.io/#https://github.com/trilogy-group/ws-eng-conduit-ai-assessment/

Once the environment spins up, you'll have a browser-based VSCode at your disposal. Two terminal tasks are launched automatically:

- "Seed": which waits for the backend to be available and runs the database seed.
- "App": which installs dependencies and starts both backend and frontend.

In Gitpod, "localhost" refers to the remote machine. All "localhost" ports are exposed to a Workspace-specific URL, which is automatically opened if you press any localhost link from the Gitpod terminal, output pane, editor, etc. To open the UI, you can press the `http://localhost:4200/` link in the App terminal (printed once the Angular app spins up) or, alternatively, you can type `gp url 4200` in a new terminal to find the URL manually.

If you are inactive for a while, your Workspace will be "paused". All file changes that you have made to the repository will be saved. You can resume it by refreshing the link or by going here: https://gitpod.io/workspaces.

Note that some Firefox users might face a "Security Error" when opening Gitpod; see [this issue for details and workarounds](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/9386).

## Hints

- You can access the UI at http://localhost:4200 and log in with `jcosten0@purevolume.com` / `password`.
- You can also find the backend API spec at http://localhost:3000/docs.
- You can run nx commands by running `npm run nx -- <command here>`, e.g., `npm run nx -- g @nx/angular:library something`.

## Tests

Note that while tests are essential to any real-life project, this repository does NOT include tests to keep the assessments short. Candidates are not required to write new tests.

## Exporting your Changes

If the assessment you are working on asks for a git patch, make sure that all your changes are committed locally and then export a git patch of your changes. You can do this by running the `./create-patch.sh` script provided in this repository. This will create a patch in the current folder. You can open it to ensure that all your changes are present (it's just a text file). On Gitpod, you can right-click to download it. You can then upload it to Google Drive and share it as part of your submission. Please make sure to share the file with "anyone with the link can view" permissions.
