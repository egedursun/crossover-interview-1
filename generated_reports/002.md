**Date:** [Submission Date]

## Feature Overview

**Feature Title:** The Conduit Roster  
**Description:** This feature aims to provide readers with a rank-ordered list of authors based on the number of favorites received on their articles. This allows readers to discover and follow the most popular authors on the Conduit platform.

## Development Environment

**Environment Setup:** Used Gitpod as recommended for setting up the development environment.  
**Repository Setup:** Cloned the provided code repository and ensured the environment is ready for feature development.

## Feature Implementation

### Code Analysis

- Analyzed the provided codebase to understand the current structure and design patterns used.
- Identified entities and modules that pertain to user profiles, articles, and their associated favorites.
- Located the frontend components responsible for rendering user information to understand how to introduce the new Roster page.

### Design & Implementation

- Designed a new service method to fetch the necessary author statistics:
  - Total number of articles authored
  - Total number of favorites received on their articles
  - Date of the first posted article

- Enhanced the Roster page to include a dynamic table that lists authors and their associated statistics.

### Code Adjustments

- Created a new backend API endpoint to serve the rank-ordered list of authors and their statistics.
- Implemented a new frontend service method to consume the API endpoint and provide data to the Roster component.
- Adjusted the Roster component to handle the dynamic rendering of authors' statistics in a table format.

### Local Testing

- Conducted manual testing to verify the functionality against the acceptance criteria.
- Ensured that the new API endpoint returns data as expected and that the frontend correctly displays the information.
- Created acceptance tests based on provided criteria to validate the feature manually.

## Code Changes Patch File

- Generated a git patch file after making local commits. The file contains all the changes made to implement the new feature.

## Acceptance Tests

**Given:** User is logged in  
**When:** User opens the “Roster” page  
**Then:** All Conduit users are displayed with correct stats, sorted correctly  

```javascript
describe('Roster Page', () => {
  it('should display all users with stats and sorted by number of favorites', () => {
    cy.login();
    cy.visit('/roster');
    cy.get('.roster-table').find('tr').should('have.length.at.least', 1);
    // Additional test code to verify sorting and information correctness
  });
});
```

**Given:** User is logged in and creates a new article  
**When:** User opens the “Roster” page again  
**Then:** The user's total number of articles is incremented  

```javascript
describe('Roster Page after article creation', () => {
  it('should increment the total number of articles for the user', () => {
    cy.login();
    cy.createArticle();
    cy.visit('/roster');
    cy.contains('td', '[Your Username]').parent('tr').find('.article-count').should('have.text', '1');
    // Additional test code to verify the article count increment
  });
});
```
